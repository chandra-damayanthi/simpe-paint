This is the app's starting code. More and more functionality will be added to the feutre as time goes on. Additional math-related features will be added to the app in the near future. I'll add the github project link so you can contribute or clone the whole project. I think it's a good idea to clone all of the files spatially because as I add more features, the code gets a lot bigger.This is the app's starting code.
